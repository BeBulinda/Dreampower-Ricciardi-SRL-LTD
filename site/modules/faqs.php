                        <p>As a rule, LED bulbs use 80% to 90% less electricity 
                            than standard bulbs. They have an unparalleled even 
                            spectrum of light and have a lifespan beyond ten years. 
                            LED’s provide us the most efficient way to save energy and 
                            conserve our natural resources. If LED’s were implemented right 
                            now universally, we would not need to build another power plant. 
                            LEDs would actually eliminate the need for over 30 existing power plants.</p>

                        <h3 class="topmargin_0">2. Do LED light bulbs contain mercury?</h3>
                        <p>No. LED bulbs do not contain mercury. They can actually 
                            be recycled as they do not contain hazardous substances 
                            and are manufactured without hazardous substances.</p>

                        <h3 class="topmargin_0">3. How do LED light bulbs compare to CFL bulbs?</h3>
                        <p>Studies show LED bulbs use 50% less energy than CFL bulbs 
                            and in many cases last 10 times longer than CFL light bulbs. 
                            They are much more durable, environmentally friendly, vibrant 
                            and shock resistant and offer excellent light quality, both 
                            indoor and outdoor.</p>

                        <h3 class="topmargin_0">4. Do LED bulbs produce as much heat as CFL or Incandescent bulbs?</h3>
                        <p>LED light bulbs emit much less heat than a CFL or incandescent 
                            bulb. In many cases, you can actually feel the temperature 
                            difference just by being near the light. LED bulb lights 
                            will always operate at a lower temperature than a CFL or 
                            incandescent which has immediate benefits in reduced 
                            cooling bills in the summer months where we are paying 
                            for our Air Conditioning to cool our offices.</p>

                        <h3 class="topmargin_0">5. Why are LED lights more expensive?</h3>
                        <p>LED light bulbs use an actual circuit board to operate 
                            and are made of electronic components. Essentially, 
                            the could be considered an electronic device. This 
                            technology continues to gain advantages almost daily. 
                            The manufacturing and supply/ demand of general lighting 
                            products are gearing up today, and we will see costs continue 
                            to decline as the adoption rate of LED Lighting increases.</p>

                        <h3 class="topmargin_0">6. Is LED light a different type of light?</h3>
                        <p>Yes, LED light is said to be safer, healthier light. 
                            LEDs do NOT produce any sort of ultraviolet radiation 
                            which causes fabric fading, color fading in Art, carpeting 
                            and other soft goods. There is none of the ‘buzzing’ or 
                            ‘flickering’ that many people are sensitive to with LED 
                            Lights. Residential and especially commercial and industrial 
                            plants, stores libraries, galleries, and water houses can 
                            immediately benefit from LED Lighting.</p>

                        <h3 class="topmargin_0">7. How long do LEDs for general lighting really last?</h3>
                        <p>Remember, the longevity of LED can be 100,000 hours. LED’s 
                            are solid state devices (SSL- or “solid state lighting”); 
                            they will not burn out. Life expectancy for SSL lighting 
                            is upward of 50,000 to 100,000 hours or more which means 
                            no maintenance costs for facilities workers to replace lights. 
                            Over time, the cost of the fluorescent or incandescent bulbs 
                            themselves can add up to a significant savings when converting to LED’s.</p>
